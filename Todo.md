# This game needs to contain.
Player ship
    - [x] Can be moved by player, up, down, left and right
    - [x] Can't go outside the screen
    - [x] Player can shoot bullets (2 at a time)
    - [x] Takes damage by colliding with enemy bullets or enemy ships
    - [x] Doesn't take damage by colliding with own bullets

Enemy Ship
    - [x] Moves diagonally down, "bouncing" on the edges of the screen

    - [x] Takes damage by colliding with player bullets or player ship
    - [x] Doesn’t take damage by colliding with enemy bullets
    - [x] Spawns at a random position, but always fully outside the screen at the top (not too far away)
    - [x] If it exits the bottom of the screen, it moves back up, making it even more difficult
    - [x] As time goes by, new enemies are spawned faster and faster, but never fast enough to become impossible 
        (There are different approaches to this, pick one that you can argue makes the game fun)
Bullets
    - [x] Movement direction is based on the ship that fired it
    - [x] Is destroyed when colliding with a differently allied ship
    - [x] Both player and enemies shoot bullets of the same class

    - [x] Score is displayed on screen
    - [x] Is reset when the game is lost
Explosions
    - [x] Enemy ship explodes when damaged
    - [x] Colliding with explosions does not affect any ships or bullets
Health
    - [x] Players health is displayed on screen
    - [x] Player loses health when taking damage
    - [x] When health == 0, the game is lost. (You shouldn’t need to restart the game executable to play again.)
Graphics
    - [x] All of the above game elements have a functional graphical representation
    - [x] Both textures and Fonts are used
Optimization
    - [x] The player should theoretically be able to play “forever” without the game breaking 
        hint: clear bullets from memory when they exit the screen.
Code
    - [ ] Should be structured appropriately and follow Object Oriented principles with reasonable coupling and cohesion
    - [ ] Shouldn’t have unnecessary repetition of code, or code that isn’t used
    - [ ] Should be clear and well-structured enough to understand for another programmer, in regards to both readability and usability
    - [ ] It should be sufficiently easy to add new features or make changes to existing ones, as well as reuse different parts for other games
## Needs all bonus Features (for grade VG)
    - [ ] Let the player enter a name
    - [ ] A High-Score list that is persistent between sessions
    - [ ] A main menu with (at least) the alternatives “New Game”, “High score” and “Quit”
